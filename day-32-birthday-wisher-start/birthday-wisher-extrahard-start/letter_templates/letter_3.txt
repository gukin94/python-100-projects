Dear [NAME],

Every word you confide in me, every wonderful and terrible moment you share with me, melts me inside.
You let yourself be vulnerable with me and trust me beyond my comprehension.
I never imagined I would truly find another who I would want to spend so much time with, who could truly touch my life the way you have, even without trying. I look forward to many more special moments together. When I see you, I see my future.

This is not just talk. It truly comes from the heart.
I am consumed by the desire to be with you, to talk to you and to feel you near me.
I want to hold you, talk to you, laugh with you, cry with you.
I want to play, walk, dance and just be one with you. I think you could become my everything. I know I want to be everything to you.

When we are together, I see the love in your eyes.
When you envision your future, do you see me in it, waiting with open arms?
I love you truly, madly, deeply, and I anxiously await your response.

Fondly as Always,
Gukin
