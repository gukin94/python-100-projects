Dear [NAME],

At night, I lie down and imagine you are here with me.
I didn't know just how heavy this separation would be in my heart.
I hope you are not in as much utter misery as I am without you.
They say absence makes the heart grow fonder, and my fondness has no bounds.

I lie awake and feel the gentle warmth of your breath as it would fall on my cheek.
I imagine the heat of your body pressed against mine; the hardness of your muscles nestling against the softness of mine.
I turn and lay my head against the pillow, feeling your heartbeat drum a lullaby in my ear.
A thousand butterflies kiss at my skin, and I long to feel the softness of your lips.

While I know we will again be together, my yearning in your absence only cements the true depth of my passion.
Until I can see you and hold you again, you will remain omnipresent in my dreams.

Yours,
Gukin
